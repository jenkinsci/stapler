/**
 * This application-scoped object that exposes adjuncts to URL.
 *
 * <p>
 * Adjuncts are packaging of JavaScript, CSS, and other static assets in jar files with dependency
 * information between them. This allows JavaScript libraries and other static assets to be reused
 * across different projects through Maven/Ivy.
 *
 * <p>
 * To use {@link AdjunctManager} in your application, create one instance, and bind it to URL
 * (like you do any other objects.) The most typical way of doing this is to define it as a
 * field in your top-level object.
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyApplication {
 *     public final AdjunctManager adjuncts = new AdjunctManager(context,getClass().getClassLoader(),"/adjuncts");
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * How you include an adjunct will depend on your template language, but for example in Jelly you do:
 * <pre>{@code <st:adjunct includes="org.kohsuke.stapler.bootstrap"/>}</pre>
 *
 * Or from Groovy you do:
 * <pre>{@code adjunct "org.kohsuke.stapler.bootstrap"}</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * ... and this produces a series of {@code style} and {@code script} tags that include all the
 * necessary JavaScript, CSS, and their dependencies.
 *
 * <p>
 * Internally, this class provides caching for {@link Adjunct}s.
