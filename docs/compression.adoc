== Static resources are sent with gzip

When clients request static resources, stapler will send it with gzip as
the content encoding whenever it can, to minimize the size of the data
to be transferred. This only happens when the MIME type of the resource
is "text/*", or the file extension is one of the well-known text file
type.

This happens all transparently, so there's nothing you nor the browser
have to do.

== Sending compressed stream from the `doXXX` methods

If you are writing action methods that serve text content, and if you'd
like to compress the stream, you can call
`StaplerResponse.getCompressedOutputStream` (instead of
`StaplerResponse.getOutputStream`) or
`StaplerResponse.getCompressedWriter` (instead of
`StaplerResponse.getWriter`) and then write to them normally.

If the client doesn't support HTTP compression, these methods will
silently revert to the normal uncompressed streams.

== Using compression from Jelly view

If your view script produces text content, and if you'd like to compress
the stream, put `<st:compress xmlns:st="jelly:stapler">` as the root
element of your view, like this:

[source,xml]
----
<st:compress xmlns:st="jelly:stapler" ... other ns decls ...>
  <html>
    <head>
      ...
----

If the client doesn't support HTTP compression, stapler will silently
revert to the normal uncompressed stream.
