Improvements:
 
[Issue 76: Parallel request routing for Blue Ocean](https://github.com/stapler/stapler/issues/76)
 
Allows 'parallel request routing'. This will allow BlueOcean or any Jenkins plugin to tweak request routing, for example to serve request routes that otherwise be served by jelly views as JSON response.
