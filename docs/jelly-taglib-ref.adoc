The following Jelly tag libraries are defined in this project.

[#jelly]##

== jelly:stapler

Optional Jelly support, to write views in Jelly.

This tag library is link:taglib-jelly.xsd[also available as an XML
Schema]

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Tag Name |Description
|#jelly:statusCode[statusCode] a|
Sets HTTP status code.

This is generally useful for programatically creating the error page.

|#jelly:redirect[redirect] |Sends HTTP redirect.

|#jelly:parentScope[parentScope] |Executes the body in the parent scope.
This is useful for creating a 'local' scope.

|#jelly:out[out] |Tag that outputs the specified value but with
escaping, so that you can escape a portion even if the
org.apache.commons.jelly.XMLOutput is not escaping.

|#jelly:once[once] |Tag that only evaluates its body once during the
entire request processing.

|#jelly:nbsp[nbsp] |Writes out '&nbsp;'.

|#jelly:isUserInRole[isUserInRole] |

|#jelly:include[include] |Tag that includes views of the object.

|#jelly:header[header] |Adds an HTTP header to the response.

|#jelly:findAncestor[findAncestor] |Finds the nearest tag (in the call
stack) that has the given tag name, and sets that as a variable.

|#jelly:documentation[documentation] a|
Documentation for a Jelly tag file.

This tag should be placed right inside the root element once, to
describe the tag and its attributes. Maven-stapler-plugin picks up this
tag and generate schemas and documentations.

The description text inside this tag can also use Textile markup

|#jelly:doctype[doctype] |Writes out DOCTYPE declaration.

|#jelly:customTagLibrary.StaplerDynamic[customTagLibrary.StaplerDynamic]
a|
When <d:invokeBody/> is used to call back into the calling script, the
Jelly name resolution rule is in such that the body is evaluated with
the variable scope of the <d:invokeBody/> caller. This is very different
from a typical closure name resolution mechanism, where the body is
evaluated with the variable scope of where the body was created.

More concretely, in Jelly, this often shows up as a problem as inability
to access the "attrs" variable from inside a body, because every

org.apache.commons.jelly.impl.DynamicTag invocation sets this variable
in a new scope.

To counter this effect, this class temporarily restores the original
"attrs" when the body is evaluated. This makes the name resolution of
'attrs' work like what programmers normally expect.

The same problem also shows up as a lack of local variables ? when a tag
calls into the body via <d:invokeBody/>, the invoked body will see all
the variables that are defined in the caller, which is again not what a
normal programming language does. But unfortunately, changing this is
too pervasive.

|#jelly:copyStream[copyStream] |Copies a stream as text.

|#jelly:contentType[contentType] |Set the HTTP Content-Type header of
the page.

|#jelly:compress[compress] |Outer-most wrapper tag to indicate that the
gzip compression is desirable for this output.

|#jelly:attribute[attribute] a|
Documentation for an attribute of a Jelly tag file.

This tag should be placed right inside

org.kohsuke.stapler.jelly.DocumentationTag to describe attributes of a
tag. The body would describe the meaning of an attribute in a natural
language. The description text can also use Textile markup

|#jelly:adjunct[adjunct] |Writes out links to adjunct CSS and
JavaScript, if not done so already.
|===

escaping.
